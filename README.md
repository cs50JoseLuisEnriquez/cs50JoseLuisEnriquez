# cs50L - Hello!
This is Jose. I'm currently enrolled in the Harvard University class CS50L through EDx online learning platafform.

## Courses
At the moment learning a lot about interesting topics related to the art of programming and the legal aspects behind it helps me to make better decisions when implementing programming concepts in projects.

## Goals
My goal is to successfully finish the cs50L course in this current year (2024).

## Programming level
I started this course just having a basic idea about coding. Iâ€™m very excited to apply all I am learning in my projects, especially in web development.

## Credits
I am very pleased with the video lectures conducted by David and Dough and the way they explain complex concepts facilitating the understanding of them and their importance.

## Assignments
I already submitted my first assignment using GitHub, Git, Visual Studio Code Universal and Scratch. Very useful tools!!

## Contributions
Your are welcome to make useful, professional and lawful contributions in terms of suggestions, questions and coaching related to programming learning by "commit" sending.

## Disclaimer
Please do not copy the solutions; instead follow the steps to understan them, practise by righting yourself the code in your projects.
